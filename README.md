=============

**Important:** Check out the "Wiki" tab above!

These are some example IPython Notebooks for us to share as we learn. GitHub is like Dropbox, but better
for passing around code and managing shared projects, because we get a high level of control over
whether our edits affect the rest of the group, without having to manually copy files or keep track of old versions.
There's a bit of a learning curve, but once you "get it," you'll be amazed at how it simplifies collaboration.

The free GitHub client for Mac makes this even easier. Check out the "Clone in Mac" button above.

The repository you see is for general-purpose teaching and learning. If you sign up for a free GitHub account
and tell me your username (please do!), I can give you permission to upload your own changes to it and edit the wiki.
Once you've done that, you can also create your own repositories to collaborate on other projects.

Please note that everything on Github is public. It's possible to create private repositories elsewhere; I can show
you how.
